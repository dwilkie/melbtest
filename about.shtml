      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Melbourne Testing Services Pty Ltd was established in 1999.The Managing Director of the company,
        Rod Wilkie, was previously employed for 16 years by a Melbourne based research and development laboratory,
        gaining considerable first-hand experience in mechanical testing, structural testing and laboratory management.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the ever increasing need for manufacturers of materials and components to ensure that 
        their products conformed to design specifications, that motivated Rod to 
        establish Melbourne Testing Services, a public testing company that specialises 
        in destructive testing, proof load testing and R&amp;D services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Melbourne Testing Services is accredited with the National Association of Testing Authorities 
        (NATA) and complies with the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025 (1999) ensuring that all testing is carried
        out in accordance with strict quality control initiatives and all relevant Australian and
        International Standards are adhered to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our accredited laboratory is equipped with a wide range of mechanical and structural testing equipment,
        including a 500kN servo hydraulic testing frame suitable for testing large structures.
        A modern 300kN servo-electromechanical, universal testing machine also compliments the the MTS laboratory.
        This machine is operated by a closed loop computer control system which enables accurate test results
        for a large range of tension, shear and compression tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from mechanical and structural testing services, MTS also provides consultancy services
        for failure analysis, structural integrity and site inspection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confidence in knowing the performance attributes and strength of products is an important consideration 
        for manufacturers, retailers and end-users. We specialise in compression, 
        tension and bend testing of materials and products. Testing can be conducted to 
        destruction or proof loaded to ensure that products have adequate strength to 
        perform as intended.
