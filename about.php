    <p>
      Melbourne Testing Services Pty Ltd was established in 1999. The Managing Director of the company, Rod Wilkie, was previously employed for 16 years by a Melbourne based research and development laboratory, gaining considerable first-hand experience in mechanical testing, structural testing and laboratory management.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the ever increasing need for manufacturers of materials and components to ensure that their products conformed to design specifications, that motivated Rod to establish Melbourne Testing Services, a public testing company that specialises in destructive testing, proof load testing and R and D services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melbourne Testing Services is accredited with the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) and complies with the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025 (2005) ensuring that all testing is carried out in accordance with strict quality control initiatives and all relevant Australian and International Standards are adhered to.

      Confidence in knowing the performance attributes and strength of products is an important consideration for manufacturers, retailers and end-users. We specialise in compression, tension and bend testing of materials and products. Testing can be conducted to destruction or proof loaded to ensure that products have adequate strength to perform as intended.
